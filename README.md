# Personal-Python-Projects

Here you see my own Python projects. You see small projects to largest projects. Check my second branch.
Mostly I'm using these libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter, Plotly, Request.

Probably I have some mistakes in my codes by view point of clean code and object oriented programming.
